            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS is a component of software configuration management, known as version control or source control system and is the management of changes to documents, computer, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes can be identified by a number or letter code, called the revision number. For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged. Version control systems (VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors and spreadsheets, collaborative web docs and in various content management systems. Version control systems are those used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When teams design and develop software, it is common for multiple versions of the same software to be deployed in different sites and for the software's developers to be working simultaneously on updates. Bugs in the software are often only present in certain versions (because of the fixing of some problems and the introduction of others as the program develops). It may also be necessary to develop two versions of the software concurrently and none of the developers effect one another. Developers can retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately. This simple approach has been used on many large software projects. This ensures that the majority of management of version control steps is hidden behind the scenes. In software development, legal and business practice and other environments, it has become increasingly common for a single document or snippet of code to be edited by a team, the members of which may be geographically dispersed and may pursue different and even contrary interests. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. A core assumption in Git is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around various reviewers. Branches in Git are very lightweight: A branch in Git is only a reference to a single commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer is Junio Hamano. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git doesn't have a central server like Subversion. All of the commands so far have been done locally, just updating a local database. To collaborate with other developers in Git, you have to put all that data on a server that the other developers have access to. The way Git does this is to synchronize your data with another repository. There is no real difference between a server and a client - a Git repository is a Git repository and you can synchronize between any two easily. Once you have a Git repository, either one that you set up on your own server, or one hosted someplace like GitHub, you can tell Git to either push any data that you have that is not in the remote repository up, or you can ask Git to fetch differences down from the other repo. You can do this any time you are online, it does not have to correspond with a commit or anything else. Generally you will do a number of commits locally, then fetch data from the online shared repository you cloned the project from to get up to date, merge any new work into the stuff you did, then push your changes back up.</p>
